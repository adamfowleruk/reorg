# Reorg
Application to help plan your daily tasks and life. Targeted initially at those with severe ADHD.

## Background

Trying to use existing planning apps to help manage ADHD is frustrating at best. These apps are designed for multiple calendars and longer running, known, and well-defined tasks. They also require manual organisation.

Many ADHD sufferers will need to plan everything. Shower, tooth brushing, eating every 3 hours (due to meds), performing tasks without distraction, and having blocks of time for 'completing tasks' rather than spelling out each task by duration on a calendar.

Also, memory tends to be an issue, and so note taking apps and task tracking apps are also used extensively. There's no one source of information - even electronically - as each app has strengths and weaknesses. I have three calendars, one note taking app, multiple projects with tasks in my task planning app, and five devices I need to access this from.

So it's a very complex landscape making forgetting things very easily done.

## Why Reorg?

Existing apps weren't cutting it, but equally existing apps are required! You can't just tell work you're not using the work calendar. It doesn't work.

Reorg takes a similar approach to Spark in that you connect multiple sources of information, but it surfaces this in a different way. Rather than being communication focused, it's task focused. 

Reorg aims to remove distractions, act as a centre point for task and information fusion, and allow planning views and task execution views. Reorg will also point out gaps in your day, suggest appropriate and healthy tasks, and by applying rules to task sources ensure everything gets done and nothing is left out.

The name Reorg comes from when infantry complete an attack. They gather together and reorganise and replan resources and tasks ready for the next fight. This is pretty much what trying to do a day job with severe ADHD feels like.

## Personae

The issues use Personae in describing enhancements in terms of what each actor needs to accomplish.

### Adam the ADHD sufferer

Shamelessly named after myself. I like the first letter of my Personae to reflect the characteristic of the person. This makes remembering them easier (a key problem with ADHD). The below description may or may not be wholly about me.

Adam suffers from severe ADHD. He's a 30-something professional trying to get work, home, social, and volunteering activities organised. He has a house, two dogs, several friends, and some family members. He both works from home and travels to see customers on a regular basis. 

He may have others that help him with some organisational tasks, either at work or in his personal life. He will probably have people to do certain tasks for him on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, such as gardening, cleaning, paperwork.

Key problems are memory, turning up way too early for meetings, trying to please everyone by booking too much in to a day, and not realising he's double booked due to travel time and popup meetings. Other issues are distraction whilst trying to do tasks, and having to write everything down in notes and remembering verbal agreements and transfering them to tasks.
